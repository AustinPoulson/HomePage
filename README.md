# HomePage

This is my personal 'new tab' page. Feel free to use it. 

## How to use

Enter a domain you want in the list (ie `google.com`). Click `add` or hit `enter` to save it.

To remove a site, hover and click the red x.

You can also drag and drop a list into the site. Format your site list with one site per line like so:
```
google.com
github.com
discord.gg
```
Drag and drop the file to add those sites.
